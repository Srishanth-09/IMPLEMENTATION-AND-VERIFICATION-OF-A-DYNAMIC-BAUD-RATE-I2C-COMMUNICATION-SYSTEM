# IMPLEMENTATION-AND-VERIFICATION-OF-A-DYNAMIC-BAUD-RATE-I2C-COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM
. Existing research primarily focuses on protocol verification or low-power designs without implementing adaptive baud-rate control at the Register Transfer Level. There is a need for an I2C controller that supports dynamic baud-rate switching while maintaining protocol correctness and reliable data transfer.
